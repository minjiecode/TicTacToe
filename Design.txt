Design Desicions




Notification: 
Send reminder email to people who have unfinished game once a day. The body of the email include the link to the unfinished game.

Endpoints:
I changed get_average_attempt to get_active_games as the average attempts remaining does not make sense for the tictactoe game. After a new game is created, a task is added to the task queue to get the active game count and update/store it in the memcache. And the count can be accessed using get_active_games endpoint.
