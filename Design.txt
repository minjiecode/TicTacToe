Design Desicions


I used integer to represent the nine positions in the gameboard. 

0|1|2
- - -
3|4|5
- - -
6|7|8

Winning Patterns: (0,1,2),(3,4,5),(6,7,8),(0,3,6),(1,4,7),(2,5,8),(0,4,8),(2,4,6)

Use String: 


Player "O"
AI Player "X"
Blank "-"


Notification: 
Send reminder email to people who have unfinished game once a day. The body of the email include the link to the unfinished game.

Endpoints:
I changed get_average_attempt to get_active_games as the average attempts remaining does not make sense for the tictactoe game. After a new game is created, a task is added to the task queue to get the active game count and update/store it in the memcache. And the count can be accessed using get_active_games endpoint.
